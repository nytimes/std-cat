        This document analyses the respective merits of different approaches to content aggregation
        on the Web. It builds atop this comparative analysis to outline an architecture and
        requirements for a technology to support content aggregation on the Web
        (for search engines, social media, and syndication services), in a manner that follows the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority
        of Constituencies</a>, notably in privileging user experience, user privacy, as well as
        simplicity and control for authors (also often known as "<em>publishers</em>")
        [[html-design-principles]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Content aggregation involves every constituency of the Web. A core goal of this document is
        to provide a backbone to elaborate content aggregation solutions that prioritise consensus
        over the unilateral imposition of technology through excessive market power.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        "<em>A defining characteristic of the Web is that it allows embedded references to other
        resources</em>" [[webarch]]. As such, content aggregation â€” the curation of lists of
        content external to one's control â€” is as old as the Web itself and has gone through
        multiple embodiments over the decades. This historical perspective allows us to tease out
        best practices from ones that produce problematic outcomes.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Brief Overview of Existing Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        The initial aggregation format is simply HTML [[HTML]], which with its hypertext linking
        capabilities has enabled the curation resources since its inception. Widespread interest in
        allowing publishers to "push" content to users led to a codification of publisher/reader
        interactions in open protocols such as the Channel Definition Format [[CDF-SUBM]], the RDF
        Site Summary (later re-branded as Rich Site Summary and Really Simple Syndication)
        [[RSS-MEDIA-TYPE]], and Atom [[rfc4287]]. These formats mix machine-readable metadata about
        content which makes it easy to present lists of resources in a user-friendly manner, links
        to the content, and sometimes the possibility to include the entirety of the source as HTML
        (depending on publisher choice).
      </p>
      <p>
        In more recent times, a flurry of aggregator-dominated formats have emerged. They feature
        varying degrees of sophistication but have in common that they require publishers to recast
        their content into a language covering a subset of the Web platform. These proprietary
        languages range from limited, as is the case with Accelerated Mobile Pages defined by Google
        (also used by Microsoft Bing and Twitter) [[AMP]], to severely limited, as with the Apple
        New Format [[APPLE-NEWS-FORMAT]] or Facebook Instant Articles [[FBIA]]. These technologies
        have slightly different areas of focus, which can be bundling for portals (AMP or [[MIP]]),
        for apps (ANF), or for social media (FBIA) but from the perspective of users and publishers
        they are more alike than different as a set of proprietary formats with largely comparable
        properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more recent proposal, Web Packages [[WP]], has recently been discussed by the Web and
        Internet communities [[rfc8752]]. It attempts to make content distribution
        <em>look like</em> content linking. While this does lead to some improvements (as discussed
        below) this proposal has yet to garner any consensus.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Assessment Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        In comparing solutions for aggregation we rely on the following properties:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>User Experience</dt>
        <dd>
          This is measured based on whether the proposal keeps the full capabilities of the Web
          platform available or if it degrades user experience by enforcing a subset of the
          platform. Values on this dimension can be <em>optimal</em> just in case the full power of
          the Web platform is available in service of the user's experience, or <em>degraded</em>
          if the user experience is limited to a subset of the platform.
        </dd>
        <dt>User Privacy</dt>
        <dd>
          For simplicity, we treat violations of privacy as any information that leaks outside of
          the direct relationship between the user on one side, and the first party and its service
          providers on the other (as defined in [[tracking-dnt]]). Values can be <em>optimal</em>
          just in case user privacy is not worsened by the aggregation architecture (endemic
          problems of privacy on the Web notwithstanding), or <em>degraded</em> if the architecture
          specifically makes privacy worse.
        </dd>
        <dt>Content Preview</dt>
        <dd>
          This property indicates whether the aggregation architecture inherently lends itself to
          providing a rich preview for the content or if previews have to be built in an ad hoc
          manner. The values are, respectively, <em>supported</em> or <em>ad hoc</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Preloading</dt>
        <dd>
          Whether effective preloading of the content, intended to speed up click-through, can
          easily be supported. Values: <em>supported</em> and <em>not supported</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Publisher Level of Effort</dt>
        <dd>
          Several of the existing aggregations solutions function by pressuring publishers to take
          on the work of optimising aggregator platforms such that publishers are handicapped if
          they don't participate in the self-preferencing format. The philosophy of this document is
          encourage the development of an ecosystem that pushes towards the mutualistic end of the
          mutualistic-parasitic axis. Accordingly, the values along this dimension can be either
          <em>reasonable</em> when the publisher has simply to produce the content alongside
          possibly some moderate effort to render it machine-readable according to open standards,
          or <em>exploitative</em> when the architecture levies work from publishers that is
          intended solely or primarily to optimise the aggregator's platform.
        </dd>
        <dt>Revenue Model</dt>
        <dd>
          An inescapable truth is that publishers and aggregators both need to generate revenue to
          continue their operations. Revenue is typically generated directly from readers/users
          (subscriptions) or indirectly (advertising). Privacy and user experience concerns can be
          leveraged to create limitations on the capabilities of the formats, which can impact
          which parties are able to monetize the published/aggregated content. Values on this
          dimension can be <em>open</em>, meaning the creator of the content has full control over
          how revenue is derived from the work, or <em>limited</em> meaning the creator has to work
          within artificial constraints.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Potential Architectures</h2>
      <p>
        There is substantial historical precedent in content aggregation on the Web. However, it
        does not seem necessary to produce a detailed investigation of each past technology. We can
        instead outline three major architectures: the traditional one on which the Web was built,
        the one that has come to dominate in recent years and which the standards community wishes
        to improve upon, and one grounded in a consensus approach to Web architecture that addresses
        the limitations of the traditional model. Experience with historical examples can serve to
        illustrate various aspects of each architecture.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>
          Links are the original embodiment of content aggregation and remain the gold standard for
          content curation on the Web. Any viable solution should improve upon linking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linking enables a fundamental architectural property of the Web which is the separation
          of discoverability from distribution. This powerful feature is grounded in URLs, which are
          the defining architectural element of the Web and what initially set it apart from other
          hypertext systems (of which there were many).
        </p>
        <p>
          According to our methodology, links have the following properties:
        </p>
        <table class="simple">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Dimension</th>
              <th>Value</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>User Experience</th>
              <td><var>optimal</var></td>
              <td>

                how the Web platform is intended to work.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>User Privacy</th>
              <td><var>optimal</var></td>
              <td>
                The user has distinct and clearly delineated relationships with separate first
                parties being the aggregator and the publisher (especially with judicious
                application of a <code>Referrer-Policy</code> [[referrer-policy]]).
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Content Preview</th>
              <td><var>ad hoc</var></td>
              <td>
                While some de facto systems exist to provide metadata that enables limited content
                previewing (primarily in the form of "cards" intended for social media usage), there
                is currently no evident standard that could enable content preview simply from
                linking.

        <h2>Aggregator-Dominated Bundling</h2>
        <p>
          In recent years, as the Internet became increasingly concentrated around a small number of
          extremely powerful actors, the Web's dominant content aggregation architecture has shifted
          towards proprietary formats imposed by aggregators in furtherance of their own
          preferences. These share a set of broad characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They attempt to limit what the Web platform can do. This helps aggregators treat content
            as a fungible commodity rather than as differentiated production grounded in craft. They
            also privilege aggregators (and runaway scale) by favouring <em>legibility</em> of the
            content over <em>expressivity</em> and local knowledge of one's topic and audience
            [[SEEING-LIKE-A-STATE]].
          </li>
          <li>
            They tend to optimise characteristics that define the aggregator/user relationship
            (particularly performance or uniformity) over those that prevail in publisher/user
            relationship (experience or trust). Put differently, they constitute a faster way to
            deliver a degraded experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            They make publishers do work to optimise the aggregator's offering as a levy that must
            be discharged to maintain traffic or revenue. Little value is derived from the
            aggregation architecture itself, and in fact "<em>several online publishers indicated
            that if it weren't for the privileged position in the Google Search carousel given to
            AMP content, they would not publish in that format.</em>" [[rfc8752]]
          </li>
        </ul>
        <table class="simple">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Dimension</th>
              <th>Value</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>User Experience</th>
              <td><var>degraded</var></td>
              <td>
                Every technology in this architecture class degrades the user experience by limiting
                the capabilities of the Web platform to those deemed useful and legible by the
                aggregator. Web Packages [[WP]] attempts principally to solve this issue.
              </td>
            </tr>

              <th>User Privacy</th>
              <td><var>degraded</var></td>
              <td>
                Technologies in this group try to shift relationships that users expect to have with
                publishers towards relationships with aggregators instead, sometimes even providing
                deceptive indications regarding the URL from which the content is served, leading
                data to leak from a publisher context to an aggregator context.
              </td>
            </tr>

              <th>Content Preview</th>
              <td><var>supported</var></td>
              <td>
                The legibility enables higher-quality preview of content. Note: in some cases,
                essentially the full content is loaded into a carousel but this use case is not
                considered here because overriding another party's interaction modalities is
                considered excessively hostile compared to the decisively mutualistic and consensual
                philosophy of this document. [[CAROUSEL]]

                The blurring of discoverability and distribution directly delivers the ability to

                Since these formats are entirely ad hoc and primarily focused on aggregator use
                cases, publishers have to work to optimise aggregators' platforms.

                Publishers often have to work within the constraints on advertising instituted by
                aggregators, if that revenue model is available at all. Support for subscription or
                login-controlled content is either not present, requires extra optimization on
                behalf of publishers, or mandates that publishers use the aggregator's own

        <p>
          Both the <a href="#links">Links</a> and the
          <a href="#aggregator-dominated-bundling">Aggregator-Dominated</a> approaches have
          different shortcomings. The approach advocated by the <em>Cooperative Syndication</em>
          aggregation architecture stems from multiple principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It should be the product of consensus amongst the various constituencies of the Web so
            as to reflect a healthy balance of power in the global digital ecosystem and not
            imposed unilaterally by a single actor simply by dint of overwhelming market power. This
            is essentially a return to Open Stand principles in lieu of monopoly power.

          <li>
            It should maintain the architectural values supported by URLs in general, and the
            discoverability/distribution distinction in particular.
          </li>
          <li>
            It should proceed through
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#evolution-not-revolution">evolution,
            not revolution</a>: do not make massive architectural changes to address simple

                An existing ecosystem of metadata, principally stemming from social media "card"
                languages as well as from schema.org [[schema-org]] exists and is waiting for
                nothing more than some further formalisation and extensions to render it capable of
                more powerful previewing. The following section provides some high level examples of
                the direction in which these existing capabilities could be developed.

              <td>
                This is a relatively more difficult feature to develop, however it can usefully be
                approached in a generic manner. Prefetching using stateless requests and IP privacy
                can already go a long way towards addressing the issue. Publishers could further
                rely on bundling (unsigned, simply served from their domain) to enable more
                effective prefetching.

              <td><var>reasonable</var></td>
              <td>
                Under this architecture, the bulk of work that publishers need to carry out is to
                enhance their existing content with better machine-readable metadata, and possibly
                with some bundling that they could themselves use on their own sites. Overall, this
                presents a reasonable increase compared to linking and a substantial improvement
                over aggregator-dominated bundling.

                Publishers would be free to continue their existing revenue models based on users

      <h2>Requirements for Cooperative Syndication</h2>
      <p>
        Further discussion on the community's preferred architecture are warranted before too much
        work is invested into outlining detailed requirements. Some aspects of the Cooperative
        architecture are nevertheless worth calling out early, even if only in outline at this
        stage.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Standardising Card Preview</h2>
        <p>
          Multiple ways exist on today's Web to provide preview capabilities through "cards", used
          on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and reused by other parts of the
          ecosystem (eg. Slack or Keybase). Additionally, the schema.org language [[schema-org]],
          incarnated through multiple syntaxes, is widely used in content.
        </p>
        <p>
          These machine-readable (though at times presentation-oriented) features are enough to
          support user-friendly content preview and can be extended further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other implementations might borrow from or build upon Google's
          <a href="https://github.com/WICG/portals">portal proposal</a>, allowing publishers
          to control the presentation of a responsive preview that could conform to the needs
          of aggregators, while maintaining privacy and performance.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Improved Privacy-Preserving Prefetch</h2>
        <p>
          Rather than relying on blurring the distinction between discoverability and distribution
          as today's aggregator-dominated architecture tends to (and SXG furthers), the Web would be
          better-served by improvements to standard prefetching capabilities. Notably, publishers
          would be incentivised to collaborate with prefetching if it aligns with their own
          distribution being faster. This could include providing bundles (unsigned, served
          directly). If there are performance benefits to be reaped from bundling, it would be
          responsible to explore them first without modifying the Web's security model (ie. without
          the signature part that allows bundle redistribution). If the value of bundling is proven
          in practice, we can then talk about SXG.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, user agents should be encouraged to develop support for IP privacy in
          service of their users' reasonable expectations of privacy. Such a feature, while generic,
          would also help support privacy-preserving prefetches.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Transmissible Entitlement Tokens</h2>
        <p>
          Some systems exist that enable forms of profit sharing between aggregators and publishers.
          These can follow multiple models such as subscriptions (Subscribe with Google),
          subsidising publishers to make some of their content available (Facebook News Tab), or
          sharing a tiny fraction of the revenue from content aggregator's bundle (Apple News Plus).
        </p>
        <p>
          The ecosystem would globally benefit from enabling aggregators and publishers to share
          entitlement tokens that would prove that a given user is entitled to specific access.
          This would enable business models in which publishers and aggregators work together on
          generating revenue according to their respective participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          implementation-wise, this could take the form of a non-fungible token or of some sort of
          nonce provided as part of the aggregator's linking to the publisher (possibly mediated by
          the user agent).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Machine-Readable Distribution Licenses</h2>
        <p>
          The terms under which aggregators use and reuse publisher content are often decided
          unilaterally (by the aggregator). This could be improved through the provision of
          machine-readable licenses that could for instance allow citation for the purpose of
          linking but not to provide direct answers, or could grant reuse rights for some pictures
          as part of a portal but not rights to mine the text to train digital assistants with.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Addressing In-App Browsers</h2>
        <p>
          Some aggregators run applications that embed Web rendering components that they use
          instead of a user's chosen browser. This practice, known as "in-app browsers", is an
          antipattern that causes countless problems with users not being logged in to publisher
          sites and not having their browsing preferences respected.
        </p>
        <p>
          This practice also unfairly attempts to keep users on the aggregator's property instead of
          letting users access the Web properly. Since the user's chosen agent is being substituted,
          the opportunity for privacy violations is rampant.
        </p>
        <p>
          While banning this practice entirely may be beyond the reach of the standards process,
          it would be desirable for browser engines to support an in-app busting HTTP header that
          would enable publishers to break out of aggregator apps trying to jail in their experience
          and to keep tracking user behaviour while users believe they are on another property.
